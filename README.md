## Installation

```
npm install react-native-cell-components --save
```
Awesome react-native cell components! As the package name says, components that are built around a `Cell` component. Used for a simple `ActionSheet` to a more complex `CellTags` + `SelectList`, and much more!

Tested with redux and on **RN >=0.40**

> This is currently on heavy development so expect rapid changes.
