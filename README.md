## RN 0.60?
Support for RN 0.60 is limited as the moment due to compatibility issues specially the deprecated `ListView`. Support for `FlatList` will come soon and this package might drop support for `realm` to accomodiate that.

This package will only support RN 0.59 and lower at this time. Thank you!

## Installation

```
npm install react-native-cell-components --save
```
Awesome react-native cell components! As the package name says, components that are built around a `Cell` component. Used for a simple `ActionSheet` to a more complex `CellTags` + `SelectList`, and much more!

Tested with redux and on **RN >=0.40**

> This is currently on heavy development so expect rapid changes.
